# FALSE	              0.10504998
# TRUE	              0.02109338
# It reduced the proportion of deaths by around 8 percentage points!

# That the doctors didn't wash their hands increased the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval

# (A very obvious) Conclusion
